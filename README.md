PyMonitorMQTT is a **cross-platform system monitor** (works both on Windows, Linux and macOS) that sends real time information via **MQTT**.
The information is sent every 10 seconds and the broker can perform certain actions on the monitor's computer.

Information form this client are well managed by home automation systems like [HomeAssistant](https://github.com/home-assistant/home-assistant).
**Companion integration for HomeAssistant can be found [here](https://github.com/richibrics/HassMonitorMqtt)**
